# News Aggregator Application
## Here's the plan

Okay so from now on the milo-dino work (for me at least) will be related to working on this news aggregator app. I will host it on an AWS S3 bucket and it will consist of only a front end, no backend (at least that's the goal). Depending on if/when we dabble more with NodeJS, we might be able to open this up to a more full-fledged project.


# Work and components will address the following things

- Javascript Basics
  - Function, Objects, Events   
  - AJAX
  - Promises
- Cutting Edge Javascript (Sorta?)
  - ES6 + Babel
  - Service Workers
  - See frameworks below
- CSS Basics (Say what??)
  - BEM / and other naming conventions
  - SASS/SCSS
- Task Runners + Other?
  - Grunt / Gulp
  - Webpack (We're going to use this)
- Testing + Continuous Integration / Deployment
  - Git
  - Karma + Jasmine 
  - Travis / Jenkins
  - AWS
- JS Frameworks (and new things I don't quite understand yet)
  - Angular 
  - React / Redux (We're going to use this)

# What this is
The purpose of this project is to work collaboratively on parts of this project as a team, and see your work in a (semi) real product! If you feel less experienced, you can tackle easier issues / sections and if you feel up to more advanced things, then you can try doing harder things. We'll have to get used to the whole pull request thing, branching thing, and we can talk more about this at one of our meetings.

# Where to start
I'll add this next time!

Lets go!
