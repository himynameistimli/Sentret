# News Aggregator Application
## Here's the plan

Okay so from now on the milo-dino work will be related to working on this news aggregator app. I will host it on an AWS S3 bucket and it will consist of only a front end, no backend.

I will try to work with and implement the following:

- Service Workers
- React
- Redux
- ES6
- Babel
- SASS
- AJAX calls

Lets go!
