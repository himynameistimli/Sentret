## Setting up the site

So to start, I'm just searching around for ways to set up the site.  I'm not very sure how a site should work, though I assume there should be a source (src) folder, and a dist folder somewhere.

Here's something I found doing a quick google search: (Setting up react for ES6 with webpack and babel)[https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/08/setting-up-react-for-es6-with-webpack-and-babel-2.html]
